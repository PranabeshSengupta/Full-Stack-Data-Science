# Full-Stack-Data-Science
As a Full Stack Data Science Intern, I worked on developing and deploying end-to-end data-driven solutions by combining data analysis, machine learning, backend integration, and frontend deployment. The internship provided hands-on experience with both the data science workflow and real-world application development.
