# 💼 Full Stack Data Science Internship Project

This repository contains the work completed during my **Full Stack Data Science Internship**, focusing on the complete lifecycle of a data science solution—from data analysis and machine learning to backend integration and frontend deployment.

## 🧠 Overview

During this internship, I developed a full-stack data science application that includes:
- Data cleaning and analysis
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Backend API development (to serve predictions)
- Frontend interface for user interaction
- Deployment of the complete application

This project demonstrates not only data science and machine learning capabilities but also how to make those insights accessible through a functional web application.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### 📊 Data & ML:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA and modeling

### ⚙️ Backend:
- Flask (or FastAPI) for serving ML model
- Pickle/Joblib for model deployment

### 🌐 Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap for styling

### 🚀 Deployment:
- Localhost testing
- Optional: Render, Heroku, or Streamlit for cloud deployment
